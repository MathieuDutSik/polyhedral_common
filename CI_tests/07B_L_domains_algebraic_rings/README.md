L-type domains for T-spaces from algebraic theory
=================================================

The test is done in `TestSequence.g`.
The test with `comm_choice:="Use_realimag"` corresponds to using the group `GL_n(Z[x])`.
If one uses `comm_choice:="Trivial"` the the group used is `GL_n(Z[x])` and the conjugation
operation.

Those cases are interesting but the number of cones generated is much higher than for
