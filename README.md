polyhedral common
=================

This is the set of functionality for dealing with polytopes.

Since this repository uses submodules, the cloning command is

git clone git@github.com:MathieuDutSik/polyhedral_common.git --recursive

There are a number of independent directories:
  * src_copos: for copositivity / strict copositivity functionalities.
  * src_poly: for polyhedral computations.
  * src_short: for short vector related computations.
  * src_latt: for lattice related computations
  * src_perfect: for perfect form related computations.
