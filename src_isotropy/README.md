Lattice based computation
=========================

The functions in this subdirectory allow computing with indefinite forms.

The following can be done:
  * Computing the Indefinite LLL reduction of a a form.
  * Find isotropic vector of an indefinite form.
  * Find a vector of positive norm of a form
  * Compute the signature of a quadratic form.


Algorithms
----------

A central method used is the Indefinite LLL for decomposing complicated forms.
