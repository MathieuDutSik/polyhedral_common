Indefinite form computations
============================

The functions in this subdirectory allow computing with indefinite forms.

The following can be done:
  * Compute the signature of a quadratic form.
  * Computing the Indefinite LLL reduction of a form.
  * Compute the classic LLL reduction of a form.
  * Find isotropic vector of an indefinite form.
  * Test whether a quadratic form has an isotropic vector or not.
  * Find a vector of positive norm of a form

This is the basis of subsequent developments for indefinite forms
and lattice computations.

A central method used is the Indefinite LLL for decomposing complicated forms.
